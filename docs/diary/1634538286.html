		got laptop setup. dont feel like software setup is exactly what i want, but its p close<br><br>using dwm most notably with swallow patch and st, i wanted to use wayland really bad (mainly for foot terminal, mmm feet (server+sixel strong advantage)), but a mix of just lack of maturity and being too lazy to fix the fucking dwl swallow patch made me go back to xorg. ill surely try to go back in future, just not now ig<br><br>yea it do. been not working on personal projects for a few days, half been busy since bf is living with me now half hard to be productive when im using a system im not comfortable on.<br><br>might look at janet again, i really like fennel but it has just enough *jank* from having to be compatible with lua that im liking it slowly less. may very well dislike janet more after giving it a fair try, but never know until try. sexps still best tho regardless.
