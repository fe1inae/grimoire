        dont understand how people maintain motivation, i get so tired after working on things so quick. still havent pushed myself enough to diagnose myself incapable or anything, but idk feels like things are harder for me than they should be. brain just seems to overflow with little gripes and frustrations stacking up, but each is so small. i want a perfection that isnt attainable, so get like analysis paralysis trying to figure out how to get there without being capable of knowing it. maybe in the future when im more knowledable that will become less of an issue, when i am able to know intrinsically what i need to do to accomplish x task. not getting disheartend at all currently, just annoying when i have (what i think are) good, unique (or at least unimplemented) ideas but im unable to do it myself for something that feels more than just a knowledge gap. bleh human brain cringe, but is way it is.<br><br>always been fascinated with fantasy stories wherein people can have powers/abilities that are intrinsically 'theirs', and i realized with computers you can nearly functionally have that. and i dont mean in an exclusionary way, just an invidiual they can pride themselves on and actually use at the same time. that feeling of being able to use something youve made by hand from scratch... you can obviously get the normally but i think the virtualness of the computer world makes what you can create and use much more diverse. of course theres the underlying hardware that is an order of complexity past what is reasonable for an indivdual to create, the abstractions above it at least give the <b>feeling</b> of ownership. the line there is quite blurry and trying to set a line is impossible,  but i think in function it doesnt matter. making something with your own hands/brain that serves a true practical purpose and you actually use is incredibly satisfying.<br><br>theres more pragmatic and varied things than 'feelings' of course, knowing how something works inside and out obviously has many advantages, and making from scratch allows you to reach a minimal yet subjectively perfect outcome that you cant really do otherwise.<br><br>idk, hope i can reach a level where im actually able to do things. im just dumb rn and it upsets me
