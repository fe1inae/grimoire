		bleh writing software dum. my brain sees x far ahead and fizzles at what id have to do. should actually start getting used to planning and writting things down, become less schizo. more than just vague goals, actually model the system to some extent. would help me i think, for lots of reasons. should make this site dsl better at some point.<br><br>i am liking fennel. it covers a large area of what i want for a language. i need to get better at making dsls and macros in general in it though, i dont tend to make much use of them when i use a fennel or just a lisp. just not practiced in it, maybe i need to do some macro-abuse to get me there ahaha, i should look online for some projects people have done as a starting point or something.<br><br>personal life going quite well, boringly well. the greatest frustation i have currently is with myself and being bad at what i want to do. just need to pound head against wall more i know, but that process is painful even if i want to do it.<br><br>think imma redo my window manager experience, idk why but i felt more productive when i used a floating window manager (rather than tiling). im sure its all placebo of course, but i like changing things frequently anyways. probably hurts more than helps (if it helps at all), but its just habit and i enjoy it.
