        had some interest in making a window manager again, its a much more achievable and pragmatic goal than an os. I would still be able to fine tune an interface for the most part, and would atually have real software that would be able to run on it lol.<br><br>i want to do it in wayland, x is kinda questionable and i like the control that wayland allows. currently am working on one using kiwmi, which is basically another abstraction layer above wlroots with a lua interface. writing it in fennel of course, i like fennel.<br><br>discovered window swallowing and i am in love. genuinly i think it will be the most important thing in a window manager for me from now on, up with being able to be controlled via keyboard. no need for a launcher when the terminal launches.<br><br>i had experimented with using the cage compositor (like wio does) for that swallowing effect, but unfortuntely it freezes when using what i consider the best terminal by far for wayland, foot. very sad. that plus some funkiness with the client/server (which is ideal for when terminals will sit unused in the back, just wasteful for it to cache all the font shit.)<br><br>so have to do manually, but thats fine. hopefully theres no xwayland issues, though i want to avoid that as much as possible anyways.<br><br>personal life been going well, all p good. i happy
