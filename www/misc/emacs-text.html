<h1 id="emacs%20text%20interfaces">emacs text interfaces</h1>

<p>(note: excluding exwm and weird emacs derivations that can do web stuff)</p>

<p>emacs is another common text interface you&#8217;ll find, notably with more
rich formatting options than many others. while the common joke is that
its more of an operating system than a text editor, i think its more of a
text window plugged into a lisp machine. can do about anything you want,
and its been around long enough where such a thing probably is already
made somewhere.</p>

<p>doesnt have many noteworthy default text interfaceness, in fact it has
more than id prefer of menus and the such by default, but its rare to
find someone who uses near stock configuration.</p>

<p>in terms of programs, theres mail clients, smallnet browsers, irc
clients, twitter clients, rss readers, and even a web browser. if you
really want to live inside text interfaces and like the idea of lisp
machines (im more of a forth gal myself), its pretty close to perfect. im
even tempted to use it quite a lot, but my distrust of gnu-sized projects
keeps me away. (thats a rant for another day, if ever)</p>

<p>the defaulting movement is, not commonly liked, but with some
plugins&#47;custom binds its quite solid. theres a very robust vim-like group
of plugins called evil, and its not difficult to create your own with
something like ryo modal. ive made some kakoune inspired movement
composed of the default actions before, and i quite liked it.</p>
