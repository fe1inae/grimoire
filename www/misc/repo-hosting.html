<h1 id="repository%20guidelines">repository guidelines</h1>

<p>its a bit of a tangle to juggle between different git hosting services,
so im going to lay out some very not strict rules for myself.</p>

<h2 id="fully%20self%20hosted">fully self hosted</h2>

<ul>
<li>minimal collaboration needed</li>
<li>im comfortable handling all patches alone</li>
<li>small shits and giggles</li>
<li>stuff that doesnt deserve any particular spotlight</li>
<li>super beta, not worth showing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="github">github</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>discoverability: think people would like to see it &#47; take from, and
more accessible site for CVs</p></li>
<li><p>i do not enjoy github: too many githubism features, hard to migrate a
project off of. not even largest microsoft hater, just it wayyy to
big and monolithic for my tastes, while providing unique tooling that
other services dont have (or need)</p></li>
<li><p>teaching&#47;non-techy repo: dont want to gatekeep collaboration if its
just for some non techy friends who cba to learn patching and all the
other fluff, not that much of a dick, github does certainly makes it
easier for new people</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sourcehut">sourcehut</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>want useful&#47;team collaboration or just big project: mailing lists
tickets etc all in their good ole classic forms. very portable ci for
so many platforms, even has 9front lol can even &#8220;special request&#8221; ci
over email it seems (presumably $$, but still)</p></li>
<li><p>hopefully gets more popular: once&#47;if the popularity factor of github
is negligible, only limiting factor is the from 0 knowledge to using
time, which presumably will still be higher than github. really hope
it does, sourcehut is tremendously good for open source community,
dont even think that its debatable. also just better than any
similar-scale  alternative :p</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other%20options%20that%20are%20niche%20or%20not%20yet%20there%20(imo)">other options that are niche or not yet there (imo)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>forgefed: not hugest fan of federation over self hosting but future
could lead it to worthwhile places. worth keeping an eye on (and
rooting for, id say) for sure.</p></li>
<li><p>fossil: fits weird niche of self hosted but with github tier tooling.
could fit depending on the software being held in it, but too clunky
for personal repos and too learn-new-system for everyday
collaboration.  like it a lot tbh, but fits such a weird niche i dont
have a use for it.  might make a gemini interface for, could make it
more useful to me.</p></li>
</ul>
