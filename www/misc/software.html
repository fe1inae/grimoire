<p>my personal &#8220;stuff that rocks&#47;sucks&#8221; list, continually changing.
formatted as &#8220;instead of xx&#8221; or &#8220;for xx use case&#8221;</p>

<p>!!! probably controversial&#47;stupid opinions ahead !!!</p>

<h2 id="gnu%20coreutils">gnu coreutils</h2>

<p>busybox, toybox, sbase, etc.
theres pretty solid options that exist, no excuses!</p>

<p>unless of course its like, a real reason like gmake, gawk, or something.
thats pretty hard to avoid in the world and can actually be useful
(though still painful) -w-</p>

<h2 id="web%20browsers">web browsers</h2>

<p>bleh, such a ubiquitous evil.
all options are pretty shit.
firefox is currently least shit (and what i use for now),
tied with degoogled-chromium probably.
but i expect firefox to get worse fast, mozilla being recent mozilla.</p>

<p>in an ideal world, use gemini or gopher.
in a slightly less ideal world,
use w3m, netsurf, or your flavor of small browser.
in the current and least (that i am willing to imagine) ideal world,
firefox or degoogled chromium.</p>

<h2 id="windows">windows</h2>

<p>linux, bsd, even macos id say. personal favorites are:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alpinelinux.org/">alpine linux</a><br/>
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">openbsd</a>  </p>

<p>unless you play a lot of modern games, especially ones with anticheat;
then windows probably best bet.
gl in that case lol</p>

<h2 id="x11">x11</h2>

<p>actually dont hate x11 entirely, 
but i think its worth slowly shifting to replace it.
just the fact that you can forward x11 is enough for me to distrust it.</p>

<p>wlroots has done a lot for wayland,
dont think i could recommend it before it existed.
it standardizes many protocols and makes writing a compositor much easier.
(though still harder than x11 wm)</p>

<p>i personally use river without a tiler, so always floating.
it work, im not the happiest with it but its good enough.</p>

<h2 id="text%20editors">text editors</h2>

<p>vim isnt that good. its not that bad either, but not that good.
emacs is fine if you decide to live in it. i dont, so i dont like it.
anything electron is bad (admittedly, to varying degrees).
ides are greatly overused, but do have their place in large systems.</p>

<p>id say good editors are kakoune, vis, acme, sam, textadept,
along with vi, ed, etc.</p>

<p>i use kakoune for $VISUAL personally,
i think its editing model is the best right now,
at least without heavy modification.
sadly its written in cpp and has a weird scripting language i dont at all like.
if it was more trimmed it would be near ideal for a visual editor probably.
(at least for me)</p>

<p>sam -d is my $EDITOR. more powerful than ed,
and structural regex are comparable to kakoune in function.</p>

<h2 id="docs">docs</h2>

<p>oh godddd gnu textinfo. just not that please.
id rather view html in w3m than that.
preferably though, just write manpages.
its not that hard despite its weird looking syntax.</p>

<h2 id="rss%20readers">rss readers</h2>

<p>just use rss, i dont even want to complain. just use it, please.</p>

<h2 id="music">music</h2>

<p>dont use spotify, please. for so many reasons.
get songs from (first check bandcamp) soulseek, torrents, or even youtube-dl.
just not spotify please.</p>

<p>i personally like cmus, but theres quite a lot of open source audio players.</p>
