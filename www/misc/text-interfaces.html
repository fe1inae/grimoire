<p>note: this is a current interest and contents will be updated&#47;subject to
change</p>

<p>ive always liked text interfaces, both the aesthetics and the
practicality, but ive noticed that theres nearly only the same VT100
terminal interfaces, and im a little bored of that. so this and linked
pages are a little exploration into the alternatves, where its still a
small simple text-focused interface, but built upon something other than
vt100 sequences, or adds significant new possibilities.</p>

implementing basic vt100 sequences in addition to inline media, dropdown
menus, and the ability to subdivide the character screen.</p>

<p>one of the most popular terminals emulators, includes a custom terminal
graphics implementation, modern keyboard capabilities, and a variety of
others.  written half in python and the dev is uh, opinionated to say the
least.</p>
