my personal "stuff that rocks/sucks" list, continually changing.
formatted as "instead of xx" or "for xx use case"

!!! probably controversial/stupid opinions ahead !!!

## gnu coreutils

busybox, toybox, sbase, etc.
theres pretty solid options that exist, no excuses!

unless of course its like, a real reason like gmake, gawk, or something.
thats pretty hard to avoid in the world and can actually be useful
(though still painful) -w-

## web browsers

bleh, such a ubiquitous evil.
all options are pretty shit.
firefox is currently least shit (and what i use for now),
tied with degoogled-chromium probably.
but i expect firefox to get worse fast, mozilla being recent mozilla.

in an ideal world, use gemini or gopher.
in a slightly less ideal world,
use w3m, netsurf, or your flavor of small browser.
in the current and least (that i am willing to imagine) ideal world,
firefox or degoogled chromium.

## windows

linux, bsd, even macos id say. personal favorites are:

[alpine linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/)  
[openbsd](https://www.openbsd.org/)  

unless you play a lot of modern games, especially ones with anticheat;
then windows probably best bet.
gl in that case lol

## x11

actually dont hate x11 entirely, 
but i think its worth slowly shifting to replace it.
just the fact that you can forward x11 is enough for me to distrust it.

wlroots has done a lot for wayland,
dont think i could recommend it before it existed.
it standardizes many protocols and makes writing a compositor much easier.
(though still harder than x11 wm)

i personally use river without a tiler, so always floating.
it work, im not the happiest with it but its good enough.

## text editors

vim isnt that good. its not that bad either, but not that good.
emacs is fine if you decide to live in it. i dont, so i dont like it.
anything electron is bad (admittedly, to varying degrees).
ides are greatly overused, but do have their place in large systems.

id say good editors are kakoune, vis, acme, sam, textadept,
along with vi, ed, etc.

i use kakoune for $VISUAL personally,
i think its editing model is the best right now,
at least without heavy modification.
sadly its written in cpp and has a weird scripting language i dont at all like.
if it was more trimmed it would be near ideal for a visual editor probably.
(at least for me)

sam -d is my $EDITOR. more powerful than ed,
and structural regex are comparable to kakoune in function.

[acme](https://acme.cat-v.org/)  
[vis](https://github.com/martanne/vis)  
[kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/)  
[textadept](https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/)  
[sam ](https://sam.cat-v.org/)  

## docs

oh godddd gnu textinfo. just not that please.
id rather view html in w3m than that.
preferably though, just write manpages.
its not that hard despite its weird looking syntax.

[mandoc](https://mandoc.bsd.lv/)  

## rss readers

just use rss, i dont even want to complain. just use it, please.

[sfeed my beloved](https://codemadness.org/git/sfeed/log.html)  

## music

dont use spotify, please. for so many reasons.
get songs from (first check bandcamp) soulseek, torrents, or even youtube-dl.
just not spotify please.

i personally like cmus, but theres quite a lot of open source audio players.

## computers

read books and/or go outside, too much computer is bad for the soul.
