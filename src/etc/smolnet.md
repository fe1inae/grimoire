gemini

[SUPPORTED](gemini://ulthar.cat)

newest on the block, meant to be a middle ground.
supports tls and client keys,
could make relatively intricate cgi applications if desired.
not in terms of the front-end though, main focus seems to be small consistant
visual capabilities, the client can spice it up as much as it wants from little
context. seems intriging but community (reasonably) doesnt treat it as more
than a curiosity.
