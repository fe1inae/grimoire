========

computers are kinda bad.
thats not really an uncommon opinon to have nowadays, at least in the circles
that i spectate in.
this is a list of environments that you could "live" in, while mostly
ignoring the shithole it sits on â˜º

small
-----

fit for oneoff things, but doesnt have the capability to replicate a truly
complex system.

- [varvara/uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/varvara.html)
  forth-based virtual machine with audio-visual capabilities.
  quite limited in scale, designed only for single purpose applications.

medium
------

could feasibly "live" in it with enough effort.

- [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
  certainly the most well known of this category,
  in this context its functionally a lisp machine with text buffers attatched.

- [collapse os](http://collapseos.org/download.html)
  a forth based operating system with the goal of being boot-strappable
  in the case of civilazation collapsing. or in other words, from nearly
  nothing.

large
-----

mostly full on operating systems, requires complex emulation such as qemu or
bare metal.

- [9front](https://9front.org/)
  community fork of plan9 to continue development.
  has quite a cult following and many interesting ideas.
