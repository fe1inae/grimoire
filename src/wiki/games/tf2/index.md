========

currently taking a break as warframe has my attention.

placeholder opinions include:

- the pace of the game is exaggerated
- its a good casual game (in a comp-y way)
- 12v12 will cause its downfall
- 6s should be the only gamemode
- sniper is bad for the game yet not overpowered
- merge sniper and spy with old amby and delete them both
- valve should formally put the game on life support thereby giving the 
  community the go-ahead to make balance changes and do things for themselves.
