========

i enjoy movement based shooters, generally. currently coping with there being
literally not a single solid game of that category with a applicable community.

**note:** opinions are the default and will not be marked as such.

multiplayer
-----------

overwatch
: was gm, low t500. sad loss of potential due to poor decisions. not
  unprecedented nor the last. have a shred of hope remaining for ow2, but dont
  think its likely at all. more likely to enjoy its pve than pvp i suspect.

apex legends
: possibly the only tolerable battle royale game, for a time. still one of the
  least bad i suspect, but they removed a lot of what makes it neat and
  entirely ignored the comp scene at the beginning, neutering any hope it had.
  another overwatch, except disregarding the comp scene instead of pushing it.
  and less potential due to the genre.

quake
: good. one of best game design, complexity from simplicity. consider all the 
  quakes basically the same (other than cpma), with a few noteworthy
  differences. sad quake champions isnt very good, though better than it used
  to be (still dead though).

half life (1) deathmatch
: sad i am too young and in the wrong part of the world to play this. not like
  id be welcome anyways probably, as with most of these games to be honest.
  quite an interesting one that i havent had the chance to explore very well.


dirty bomb
: a loss that is more unfortunate than anything. quite an enjoyable design
  that inspired a genre moreso than most recognize. died largely due to small
  devs having to be small devs. probably the game i wish most to be remade,
  being more friendly than quake but similar in tier for me. (at least by what
  i remember, been a long time. tinted glasses and whatnot)

singleplayer
------------

half life
: good. very good. in many ways. if i was at all a speedrunner, this is the 
  game i would predominantly play.
  also, hl1 > hl2.

dusk
: good. enjoy their comitance to user modification. boosted the retro-fps to
  popularity if i recall correctly.

ultrakill
: the meme itself. mildly overrated i think, but by **no means** bad. fast
  paced, but easily cheesed. really enjoyable music though, A+ on that.

cruelty squad
: quite a beast, and overall pretty interesting. the world is not *that*
  interesting, as its a trope that is pretty commonly explored. not overused i
  would say, but not uncommon. probably an original in this format though.
  gameplay is solid considering how scrappy the game looks, which is clearly
  intentional. not a whole ton of content, outside of 100%ing.

amid evil
: verryyy interesting graphics. i quite enjoy it. gameplay not super for me, 
  not having any hitscan was uncomfortable at first, but i got used to it.
  the world is very interesting. probably overall my favorite game from new 
  blood.

devil daggers
: fascinating appearance. wish i had the endurance to play it. not for me but 
  still recommend it.
