========

theres a lot of languages, i tend to like small ones that each fit into a niche.
both in terms of purpose driven design, and overarching paradigms.

known like
----------

- [awk](./awk.md) for its text processing focus
- [c](./c.md) for its universality and control
- [fennel](./fennel.md) for making lua enjoyable
- [forth](./forth.md) for its representation of the computer
- [janet](./janet.md) for being small yet featureful and extensible
- [shell](./sh.md) for its stupid yet versatile hackiness

should try
----------

- go for being so boring its good
- erlang for its actor model of concurrency
- [uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html)
  for its simplicity in making small gui applications

eye on
------

- (drews language, which is not ~~easily found~~ public :p)
  for its at least attempt at modernizing c while keeping it minimal and
  lightweight
