========

theres a lot of languages, i tend to like small ones that each fit into a niche.
both in terms of purpose driven design, and overarching paradigms.

known like
----------

- [awk](./awk.md) for its text processing focus
- [c](./c.md) for its universality and control
- [forth](./forth.md) for its representation of the computer
- [lisp](./lisp.md) for its representation of data
- [shell](./sh.md) for its stupid yet versatile hackiness

should try
----------

- go for being so boring its good
- erlang for its actor model of concurrency
- [uxn](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html)
  for its simplicity in making small gui applications
- zig for consolidated systems which make working cross platform easier
- nim for the hilarious macro abuse in a compiled language

eye on
------

- (drews language, which is not ~~easily found~~ public :p)
  for its at least attempt at modernizing c while keeping it minimal and
  lightweight
- odin for its hefty but not out of scope stdlib.
