disclaimer
----------

my opinions are often changing, and i dont generally check every 
thing ive written to see if it conflicts with the now.

also dont expect eloquency, this is mostly rants and compilations making up for
my poor memory.

i tend to leave things partly finished or even skeletal, so expect blanks. i
fill out things as my attention wanders, so its inconsistant.
