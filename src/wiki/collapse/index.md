========

shits probably gonna fail at some point, the world seems to balance on a 
slack rope that resonates and shakes more and more each year.

i dont think it will be as catastrophic as some believe, but regardless
it is good to prepare for a reasonable worst to, at bare minimum, cut costs.

thus we must examine what we truly need, and figure out the minimum needed
to achieve those goals. luxury to an extent is fine if you can afford it,
but you never know when that standard will drastically change. good to aim low.

this doesnt mean to conclude that, per se, a "minimalist" website is good
enough. that builds on many, many complex technologies just to render some
text. its quite unnecessary, in an extreme scenario. if we accept the black box
to do all our tasks without fail, what will we do when it does fail?

realistically, i dont believe computers are required for humanity to thrive,
at least to a reasonable extent. arguably they have been worse overall for us,
but regardless, thats not fun nor optimistic.

fundamental tasks
-----------------

- computation
- information management
- communication

all three of these combine to automation, allowing the computer to do things
that would otherwise take possibly orders of magnitude greater time.

computers should be good at what humans lack.

of course, theres something to be said in the entertainment value. not netflix,
but the theoretical mathematics of computer science. that will always be desired
to be explored, at least from some subsection of humanity.

what is required
----------------

so then what is required for that task? depending on what lengths of
communication you require, it could be a timer that does things on task in a
loop, every n seconds or hours. watering plants if it didnt rain that day,
logging information on your surroundings while you are sleeping or doing
another task.

keep in mind that computation doesnt unnecessary  require circuits and resistors,
at least in my definition. anything that follows clear logical flows to
transform an input to an output could be called a computer or computation.
gears or other physical objects can create a similar, ableit generally slower,
form of computation to electrics.

contact with other people is largely required, with sharing and receiving
information arguably the most vital element in surviving, at bare minimum
psychologically. computers can streamline this process, given a medium.

there are numerous protocols for low tech communication between computers,
perhaps most humorously @[RFC 2549](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2549),
which describes a network protocol purely using carrier pidgens. a more
reasonable proposal consists of a mesh of HAM or similar radios, which already
overlaps relatively largely with those preparing for collapse.

what does it
------------

any computer with io. not that hard, really. computers can be very, very simple
and still be able to do many things. see the hardware inside apollo 11, for
example. computation and io.
