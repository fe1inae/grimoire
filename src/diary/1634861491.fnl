 "i want to do it in wayland, x is kinda questionable and i like the control that wayland allows. currently am working on one using kiwmi, which is basically another abstraction layer above wlroots with a lua interface. writing it in fennel of course, i like fennel." (nl)
 "discovered window swallowing and i am in love. genuinly i think it will be the most important thing in a window manager for me from now on, up with being able to be controlled via keyboard. no need for a launcher when the terminal launches." (nl)
 "i had experimented with using the cage compositor (like wio does) for that swallowing effect, but unfortuntely it freezes when using what i consider the best terminal by far for wayland, foot. very sad. that plus some funkiness with the client/server (which is ideal for when terminals will sit unused in the back, just wasteful for it to cache all the font shit.)" (nl)
 "so have to do manually, but thats fine. hopefully theres no xwayland issues, though i want to avoid that as much as possible anyways." (nl)
 "personal life been going well, all p good. i happy")
