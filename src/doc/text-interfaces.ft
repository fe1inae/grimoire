ive always liked text interfaces, both the aesthetics and the practicality, but
ive noticed that theres nearly only the same VT100 terminal interfaces, and im
a little bored of that. so this and linked pages are a little exploration into
the alternatves, where its still a small simple text-focused interface, but 
built upon something other than vt100 sequences, or adds significant new 
possibilities.

ability to subdivide the character screen.
