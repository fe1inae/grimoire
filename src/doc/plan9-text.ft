plan9 text interface
.H1

the entire plan9 system centers around text manipulation, though the most
notable is certainly 
acme
http://man.9front.org/1/acme
.REF
\. it is a mouse driven interface focused on
executing external programs to modify its contents. i am quite a fan of it
philosophically, but i just cant get used to going back and forth to a mouse,
not sure if its just my setup but it hurts my wrist. too much fps gaming in
prior maybe, i have to be careful.
.PP
since acme specializes in executing text, it can be composed to be quite
interactive, allowing buttons and menus in a very transparent simple way.
i have yet to find a program that uses a keyboard which compares in this aspect,
sadly. 
.PP
without even using acme, plan9s terminal does not implement vt100 sequences at
all. doesnt even have readline-esque bindings, just a "dumb" output. this is 
made up for with its window managers, 
rio

.REF
, ability to "swallow" child
processes started from the terminal. this means that from the users perspective,
assuming the interface of the program is simple, its just a rich text interface.
this is probably the ideal imo and one of my favorite things in this realm from
plan9, it makes the desktop workflow so much more fluent just with that single
feature.
.PP
overall plan9 is focused on text interfaces, so just read about plan9 itself.
