# sshfs in fstab

it is possible to mount sshfs from fstab, so it will automatically mount on  
boot. this is quite useful obviously, and i personally use it to mount my nas  
with my music and media on.

firstly, you must make the fuse kernel module actually available from the  
start, and this can be done by appending 'fuse' into /etc/modules, at least on  
my alpine install.

then you will need to have a no password ssh key setup, which im not going to  
explain here but isnt hard. whole point is to not want to enter stuff to have  
it mount, we will inherently have to use this mildly insecure measure, at least 
 while keeping it simple.

the format inside /etc/fstab is roughly as follows, split up with newlines for  
sake of readability.

```
tr -d '\n' <<'EOF'
[USER]@[ADDRESS]:[SRC PATH] 
	[MOUNT PATH]
	fuse.sshfs 
	_netdev,follow_symlinks,idmap=user,identityfile=[KEYFILE],
allow_other,default_permissions,uid={id -u},gid={id -g}
	0 0
EOF
```

## options (poorly) explained

```
_netdev: makes it a network mount
follow_symlinks: resolve symlinks while mounting, looks like a regular file
idmap: map the uid/gid to our ids
identityfile: the key to send to the server
allow_other: allow all users to access, ie our non-root user
default_permissions: make sshfs use default permissions
uid: set desired uid
gid: set desired gid
```
